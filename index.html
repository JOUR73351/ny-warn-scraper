          Four years after Texas ranked near the bottom in voter turnout in the
          country, the state saw a double-digit percentage point increase in
          that figure for the <span class="midterm">2018 midterms</span>.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          But that wasn’t good enough to get Texas out of the bottom half of
          states, as it still lagged behind the national average and trailed all
          but 10 states this year, according to the United States Elections
          Project, which tracks the turnout rate of eligible voters nationwide.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Out of the voting-eligible population in Texas, 46.3 percent voted in
          2018. Nationwide, turnout was 50.1 percent.

          “Texas simply has not had particularly competitive elections, and the
          change in competition made a difference this year,” said Michael
          McDonald, a professor at the University of Florida who runs the United
          States Elections Project.

          This year, “campaigns had a reason to be engaged, and money flowed to
          the competitive races, which funded ads and in turn mobilized voters.
          Everything feeds on itself when there’s a competitive election,”
          McDonald said.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          To calculate turnout, McDonald divides the total number of ballots
          counted in a state by that state’s voting-eligible population instead
          of using more common metrics such as the voting-age population or
          number of registered voters. McDonald calculates the voting-eligible
          population by taking the voting-age population — everyone who is 18 or
          older — and adjusting for noncitizens and felons ineligible to vote in
          that state.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          “The voting-eligible population makes it easier to make comparisons
          across states and across time because the way states manage registered
          voters differs quite a bit,” McDonald said.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Low turnout has historically plagued Texas in part because of
          uncompetitive races at the top of the ballot. In 2014, when
          Republicans John Cornyn and Greg Abbott won their respective races for
          U.S. Senate and governor by over 20 points, just 28.3 percent of
          eligible voters cast a ballot, among the worst in the nation.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          In 2018, Democrats fielded candidates in every Texas congressional
          district for the first time in well over a decade. They were boosted
          statewide by U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s spirited bid to unseat
          Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz. O’Rourke — whose bid garnered national
          attention — fell short by less than 3 percentage points. Yet Democrats
          flipped Republican-held seats in the U.S. House, the Texas Legislature
          as well as lower on the ballot.
